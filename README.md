# space-news

<h2>A news website developed with React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS</h2>

<h2>Functionality and purpose of the application</h2>
<p>
'Space News' is a website project developed to improve my Typescript and React skills. The website uses two different REST API's, one for the up-to-date news, blog posts and reports about space activities, the other is for Picture of the Day, and each section has its own page, with a pagination system to show a rich content.

The styling and layout parts were made with Tailwind CSS and the users can use the website with a clean and completely responsive UI.
